A frontend developer with 8+ years of experience in creating complex and highly loaded web applications. I specialize in React, TypeScript, and modern JavaScript, focusing on performance, accessibility, and user-friendliness of interfaces.

I am open to interesting projects and collaborations. I am ready to discuss the possibilities of working in food companies or startups.
