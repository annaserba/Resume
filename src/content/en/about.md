A frontend developer with 8+ years of experience in creating complex and highly loaded web applications. I specialize in React, TypeScript, and modern JavaScript, focusing on performance, accessibility, and user-friendliness of interfaces.

My responsibilities included:
- MVP development, project architecture design;
- UILib development;
- Task assessment, task setting, task verification;
- Technical debt identification and prioritization;
- Employee onboarding;
- Technical standard compliance control;
- Technology stack development and innovation.

I'm looking for interesting projects and collaborations. I'm open to discussing opportunities at product companies or startups.

I also know that with the development of AI, it is much easier for experienced developers to learn unfamiliar technologies and libraries. I am a proponent of using AI in a gentle and thoughtful manner, rather than blindly generating code. Therefore, if I lack expertise in a particular part of the stack or technology, I am confident that I can quickly learn and contribute to the project.
